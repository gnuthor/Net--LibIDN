Net/LibIDN version 0.12
=======================

This module provides Perl bindings for GNU Libidn by Simon Josefsson
(http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/) in way that was heavily inspired
by PHP bindings for the same library done by Turbo Fredriksson
(http://php-idn.bayour.com/).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL [--with-libidn=<LIBPATH> --with-libidn-inc=<INCPATH> --disable-tld]
   make
   make test
   make install

Installing under Cygwin:

   Sergei Koladka reports that the first make line above needs to be replaced by

     make LD_RUN_PATH="/usr/lib" LDLOADLIBS="/usr/lib/libidn.a
         \/usr/lib/libiconv.dll.a"

   assuming that Libidn was compiled with --prefix=/usr. You also will need to
   remove the >>die "This module requires GNU Libidn..."<<-line and manually set
   $libidn either to 2 or 1 depending on whether you have/want to use TLD
   checking support.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  GNU Libidn >=0.5.0

Linux hint: If Makefile.PL says that it cannot find GNU Libidn, even though
you compiled/installed it, consider adding the location of the Libidn .so
files to /etc/ld.so.conf. Also, take a look at the --with-libidn and
--with-libidn-inc options.

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
    my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
    script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
